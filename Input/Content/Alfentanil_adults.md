### Alfentanil model

Alfentanil is another potent, short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic drug, used for anaesthesia in surgery, which is solely metabolized by CYP3A4, with less than 1% of an alfentanil dose being excreted unchanged in urine after intravenous administration. The model has been build and evaluated in healthy adults and published by Hanke et al. [1] The model applies metabolism by CYP3A4 and glomerular filtration. The alfentanil PBPK model adequately described the pharmacokinetics of alfentanil in adults.

The published alfentanil model [1] was developed using data of the following publications:
